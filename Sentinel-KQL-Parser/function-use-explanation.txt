// I have saved the parser stored in the file "function-use-explanation.txt" as a function named "PAN_OS_TrafficParser_v10_2_optional_headers" and now I can use it my KQL queries in Sentinel. 
//
// For example: 
PAN_OS_TrafficParser_v10_2_optional_headers
| where SyslogHostname == "vnp007"  
//
// Note: I am filtering specifically for the TRAFFIC sample provided in the homework assignment
// I have attempted to find a larger sample of the PAN-OS logs on the Internet, but was not successful. 
// I eventually used AI help to generate a larger sample log. 
// I was able to use it to test the TRAFFIC vs non-TRAFFIC logs forwarding, 
// and adjusted it to at least match the required number of 115 CSV fields, 
// but many values in the AI-generated sample of the log were not ordered correctly. 
// I eventually gave up on fully fixing the sample, and just verified that the values at least ended up 
// where they were supposed to be according to the "disordered" sample. 
// After I created the parser, I opened the log sample that I used in an excel sheet 
// with addition of the field names on top, and cross-referenced it with the resulting fields created by the parcer. 
// They were all split correctly. 
// However, for clarity of the results for the assignment, 
// I specifically search for the  "vnp007" value which is unique to the sample log provided.
// This would make it easier to verify that the logs are actually being parsed correctly, 
// and remove any confusion caused by the disordered samples generated by the AI.
