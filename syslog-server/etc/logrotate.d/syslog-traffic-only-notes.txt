Note: This text file is here just to provide explanations to the actual "syslog-traffic-only" config file in the same folder, as it does not work with the comments. 
Use the actual config file to set up log rotation of the "evidence" log file on the syslog server, or it would not work otherwise.

# This logrotate configuration handles the rotation of the single, static
# log file for "TRAFFIC" logs. The settings are designed for a low-resource
# demo environment while still following best practices.

    # Rotate the log file once a day. This ensures the file doesn't grow
    # too large and is manageable for analysis, which is important for a demo
    # with limited disk space.

    # for easy access without decompressing it.
